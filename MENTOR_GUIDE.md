### Step 2: Weekly Rhythm (1-2 hours/week)

**Each Week Follow This Pattern:**

#### Monday-Tuesday: Mentee Self-Study
- Mentee reads tutorial
- Watches videos
- Takes notes
- Starts exercises

#### Wednesday-Friday: Mentee Exercises
- Completes hands-on exercises
- Applies concepts to SauceDemo
- Documents work in GitHub
- Reaches out with questions

#### Weekend/Week End: Deliverables
- Finishes deliverables
- Commits to GitHub
- Prepares for mentor session
- Reviews checklist

#### Mentor Session (60 minutes)
**Structure:**
- **Check-in (10 min):** Review progress, celebrate wins
- **Concept Discussion (20 min):** Clarify concepts, answer questions
- **Hands-On Demo (20 min):** Live demo, work through example together
- **Planning (10 min):** Preview next week, set expectations

---

### Step 3: Content Development (As Needed)

You have two options for Weeks 2-11:

**Option A: Use Summary + Customize**
- Use WEEKS_2-11_SUMMARY.md as your guide
- Create detailed tutorials as needed based on mentee's pace
- Focus on what mentee needs most

**Option B: Create Full Content**
- Use Week 1 as template
- Create tutorial.md, checklist.md, exercises.md, resources.md for each week
- More prep time, but complete materials

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A. If you find yourself explaining the same thing repeatedly, create detailed tutorial.md for that week.

---

## 📚 Week-by-Week Mentor Focus

### Week 1: Set Foundation
**Your Focus:**
- Ensure mentee understands QA's value (not just bug finding!)
- Help them explore SauceDemo thoroughly
- Emphasize importance of documentation
- Set expectations for program

**Common Questions:**
- "What's the difference between QA, QC, and Testing?" → Use examples
- "Which SDLC model is best?" → It depends on context
- "Do I need to know coding?" → Basic understanding helps, but QA ≠ developer

**Red Flags:**
- Not committing work to GitHub
- Rushing through SauceDemo exploration
- Skipping exercises

---

### Week 2: Build Clarity on Test Levels
**Your Focus:**
- Help mentee understand *why* test levels exist
- Emphasize cost of finding bugs late
- Connect to their work experience (if any)

**Common Questions:**
- "Don't developers do all testing?" → No, different levels, different people
- "Why do we need so many levels?" → Cost, focus, expertise

**Activity:** Show pyramid diagram, discuss real project example

---

### Week 3: Master Functional Testing
**Your Focus:**
- Exploratory testing is powerful (not just "random clicking")
- Negative testing is as important as positive
- Help them think like attackers/users

**Common Questions:**
- "How long should exploratory testing take?" → Time-boxed, goal-oriented
- "How many test cases is enough?" → Coverage, not just count

**Activity:** Do 15-minute exploratory testing session together

---

### Week 4: Appreciate Non-Functional Quality
**Your Focus:**
- NFRs are often overlooked but critical
- Share real-world failure stories (security breaches, slow apps)
- Usability = competitive advantage

**Common Questions:**
- "Can I really test security without tools?" → Yes, manual security checks matter
- "How do I measure usability?" → Observe users, time tasks, ask questions

**Activity:** Do usability evaluation together, share findings

---

### Week 5-6: Apply Test Design Techniques
**Your Focus:**
- These techniques feel academic but save time and increase coverage
- Show ROI: fewer tests, better coverage, find more bugs
- Practice together

**Common Questions:**
- "When do I use each technique?" → Share decision matrix
- "Is it worth the effort?" → Yes! Industry standard, job interview topic

**Activity:** Walk through one technique together on SauceDemo feature

---

### Week 7: Create Professional Test Plan
**Your Focus:**
- Test planning seems tedious but essential
- Saves time, manages expectations, shows professionalism
- This goes in their portfolio!

**Common Questions:**
- "How detailed should it be?" → Depends on audience, but be thorough
- "Who reads test plans?" → Managers, stakeholders, other QA

**Activity:** Review their draft test plan, give specific feedback

---

### Week 8: Write Quality Test Cases
**Your Focus:**
- 50 test cases is substantial - celebrate progress!
- Quality > quantity
- Consistency and clarity matter

**Common Questions:**
- "Are my test cases too detailed?" → Better detailed than vague
- "Should I automate these?" → Not in this program, but know which ones would benefit

**Activity:** Review 5-10 test cases together, suggest improvements

---

### Week 9: Connect to Agile World
**Your Focus:**
- Most companies use Agile - this is critical knowledge
- BDD bridges communication gap with developers/product
- Given-When-Then is powerful

**Common Questions:**
- "I've never worked Agile - is this realistic?" → Yes, it's the norm now
- "Do I have to write code for BDD?" → No, Gherkin is English-like

**Activity:** Convert a test case to BDD format together

---

### Week 10: Perfect Bug Reporting
**Your Focus:**
- Bug reporting is an art
- Good reports help developers fix faster
- Empathy matters

**Common Questions:**
- "How do I know severity vs priority?" → Teach the matrix
- "What if I can't reproduce?" → Document what you know, mark as "intermittent"

**Activity:** Review their bug reports, show professional examples

---

### Week 11: Gentle Python Introduction
**Your Focus:**
- Python is optional/light in this program
- Focus on practical scripts, not deep programming
- Celebrate small wins

**Common Questions:**
- "Do I need to be a programmer?" → No, basic scripting is enough
- "What if I get stuck on Python?" → That's okay, focus on test data generation

**Activity:** Write a simple script together (test data generator)

---
