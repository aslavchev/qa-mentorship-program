## 🚀 How to Get Started (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Review Core Documents (1-2 hours)

**Read in this order:**
1. This file (START_HERE.md) ✅ You're here!
2. README.md - Program overview
3. MENTOR_GUIDE.md - How to deliver program ⭐ ESSENTIAL
4. WEEKS_2-11_SUMMARY.md - Content for all weeks

### Step 2: Explore Week 1 Content (1 hour)

Navigate to `week-01-qa-foundations/` and review:
- tutorial.md (see the depth and style)
- checklist.md (see the tracking approach)
- exercises.md (see the hands-on activities)
- resources.md (see the curated resources)

**This is your template for other weeks!**

### Step 3: Check Templates (30 minutes)

Browse `templates/` folder to see professional QA document formats.
Your mentee will use these throughout the program.

### Step 4: Plan Your Approach (30 minutes)

**Decision: How to handle Weeks 3-11?**

**Option A (Recommended): Just-In-Time Content**
- Use WEEKS_2-11_SUMMARY.md as your guide
- Create detailed tutorials only when needed
- Focus on mentee's questions and needs
- Faster to start, more flexible

**Option B: Create All Content Upfront**
- Use Week 1 as template
- Create all 4 files for each week before starting
- More prep work, but complete materials
- Better if you want to reuse with multiple mentees

### Step 5: Set Up With Mentee (30 minutes)

- Schedule 11 weekly 1-hour sessions
- Send welcome email (template in MENTOR_GUIDE.md)
- Share GitHub repository link
- Ensure they can access SauceDemo
- Schedule Week 1 session
