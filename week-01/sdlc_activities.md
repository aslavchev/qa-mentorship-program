# SDLC Activities Mapping - SauceDemo v2.0 (Agile/Scrum)

## Part A: Activity Mapping

### **Sprint Planning Phase:**
QA Activities:
1. Review user stories and acceptance criteria.
2. Prepare test data, environments etc.
3. 

### **Development Phase (During Sprint):**
QA Activities:
1. Collaborate closely with developers.
2. Prepare and update test cases.
3. 

### **Testing Phase (During Sprint):**
QA Activities:
1. Execute tests needed including smoke, exploratory and others alongside main functional tests.
2. Log defects, retest fixes, and track progress.
3. Share status and risks

### **Sprint Review:**
QA Activities:
1. Check if acceptance criteria is met.
2. Validate delivered functionality during the review session.

### **Sprint Retrospective:**
QA Activities:
1. Discuss what went well and what could improve in QA processes.
2. Suggest optimizations.

## Part B: Shift-Left Example

1. **Instead of:** Testing login after development complete  
   **Shift-left to:** Reviewing login requirements and design before implementation to ensure testability and security considerations are included early.

2. **Instead of:** Finding usability issues during testing  
   **Shift-left to:** Participating in UI/UX design reviews to identify usability concerns before coding starts.

3. **Instead of:** Discovering missing requirements during testing  
   **Shift-left to:** Collaborating during sprint planning to clarify acceptance criteria and edge cases.

## Part C: Reflection Questions

1. **Why is QA involved in requirements phase?**  
   - To ensure all requirements are clear, complete, and testable before development begins. 

2. **What happens if QA only tests at the end of development?**  
   - Defects are found late, leading to rework, delays, and higher costs. 

3. **How does early QA involvement save money?**  
   - The earlier a defect is found, the cheaper it is to fix. It usually also impacts smaller part of the project.

4. **What questions should QA ask during design phase?**  
   - How will this feature be tested?  
   - Are there any corner cases or error scenarios considered?  
   - Is the design consistent with other parts of the application?  
   - What are the performance or security issues?
