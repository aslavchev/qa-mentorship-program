## 🌟 FAANG Interview Connection

**Questions these resources prepare you for:**

1. **"How do you write a good bug report?"**
   - Reference: Simon Tatham article, Week 10 Exercise 2
   - Answer: "Essential fields are summary, repro steps, expected vs actual, environment, severity/priority. Developer should reproduce in under 2 minutes."

2. **"How do you prioritize bugs?"**
   - Reference: Severity vs Priority videos, Exercise 3
   - Answer: "Severity = technical impact, Priority = business urgency. They're independent - S1 bugs can be P3 if rare, S4 bugs can be P1 if high-visibility."

3. **"How do you measure testing effectiveness?"**
   - Reference: Defect metrics resources, Exercise 4
   - Answer: "Defect Removal Efficiency (DRE) - target is 90%+. Also track defect leakage (<10%), density, and defect hotspots."

4. **"Tell me about a time you prevented future bugs."**
   - Reference: RCA videos, Exercise 5
   - Answer: "I used 5 Whys to find root cause of cart badge bug - testing gap in negative flows. Preventive action: added 4 test cases for symmetric operations (add/remove flows)."

5. **"What bug tracking tools have you used?"**
   - Reference: Jira hands-on, GitHub Issues exploration
   - Answer: "Jira for team-managed projects, GitHub Issues for open source contributions. Familiar with creating, triaging, and tracking defects through lifecycle."
