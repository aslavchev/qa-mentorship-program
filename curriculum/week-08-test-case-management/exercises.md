## Exercise 6: GitHub Projects Test Management (60 min)

### Objective
Convert your test cases into GitHub issues for tracking and management using GitHub Projects

### Instructions

**Part 1: Create Test Case Issues (40 min)**

1. Navigate to: https://github.com/aslavchev/qa-fundamentals-11weeks/issues/new/choose
2. Select **"Test Case"** template
3. Convert your test cases from Exercises 1-5 into GitHub issues:
   - Use test case template for each issue
   - Title format: `[TEST] Brief description`
   - Add appropriate labels:
     - Test type: `test:manual`, `test:regression`, `test:smoke`, etc.
     - Priority: `priority:critical`, `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low`
   - Add to "SauceDemo Test Suite" project
4. Organize in GitHub Project:
   - Set custom fields: Test Type, Test Suite, Module, Automation Status
   - Set Last Run Status to "Not Run"

**Part 2: Explore Project Views (10 min)**

1. Open "SauceDemo Test Suite" GitHub Project
2. Explore views:
   - **Test Inventory:** See all test cases organized by module
   - **Regression Suite:** Board view of regression tests
   - **Automation Backlog:** Which tests need automation
   - **Test Execution Tracker:** Track test execution status
3. Practice filtering and sorting

**Part 3: Document Setup (10 min)**

Create documentation with:
- Total test cases created
- Breakdown by module (Login: X, Checkout: Y, etc.)
- Breakdown by priority
- Screenshots of:
  - Test Inventory view
  - Regression Suite board
  - One example test case issue

### Deliverable

Save as `mentee-work/week-08/test-management-organization.md` including:
- Summary statistics
- Screenshots of project views
- One sample test case issue link
- Reflection: Benefits of using GitHub Projects for test management

### Tips

**Batch Creation:**
- Open multiple browser tabs with issue template
- Copy/paste test steps from your markdown test cases
- Save time by using consistent formatting

**Label Strategy:**
- Every test should have: 1 test type + 1 priority + optional suite labels
- Example: `test:manual`, `test:regression`, `priority:high`

**Custom Fields:**
- Test Type: Manual (most of yours), Automated (future), Hybrid
- Test Suite: Regression (rerun often), Smoke (quick checks), Full (everything)
- Module: Login, Inventory, Cart, Checkout, User Account, Navigation
- Automation Status: Not Automated (start here)
- Last Run Status: Not Run (will update when executing tests)

- Curriculum template: `curriculum/templates/test-case-template.md`
- GitHub Projects: Built-in test management, free alternative to TestRail
