## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Do I need to learn Cucumber to complete Week 9?
**A:** No! Week 9 focuses on BDD concepts and Gherkin syntax. Cucumber is the implementation tool (Week 11 Python covers automation basics).

### Q: What's the difference between BDD and TDD?
**A:** TDD (Test-Driven Development) is code-first, developer-focused. BDD is behavior-first, business-readable. Both are valuable.

### Q: Should I read the entire "Agile Testing" book?
**A:** Not now. Read Chapter 7 (Testing Quadrants) and Chapter 9 (BDD). Save the rest for later.

### Q: What if my team doesn't use Agile?
**A:** These concepts still apply! Quadrants work in any methodology. BDD scenarios improve any test documentation.

### Q: Which certification should I get next?
**A:** After ISTQB Foundation, consider ISTQB Agile Tester Extension. It aligns with Week 9 content.

## 🎁 Bonus: Real-World BDD Scenarios

### Example from Netflix (Simplified)

```gherkin
Feature: Video Playback

Scenario: User plays video on supported device
  Given I am logged into Netflix
  And I have an active subscription
  And I am using Chrome browser on desktop
  When I select "Stranger Things Season 1 Episode 1"
  And I click the Play button
  Then the video should start playing within 3 seconds
  And the video quality should be at least 1080p
  And playback controls should be visible
```

### Example from Amazon (Simplified)

```gherkin
Feature: Shopping Cart

Scenario: Add item to cart and proceed to checkout
  Given I am logged in as a Prime member
  And I am viewing "Echo Dot (5th Gen)"
  When I click "Add to Cart"
  And I navigate to my cart
  Then the cart should contain 1 item
  And the item should be "Echo Dot (5th Gen)"
  And the subtotal should be $49.99
  And "FREE Prime Delivery" badge should be visible
```

**Study these real-world examples** - notice how they're business-readable, specific, and testable!
