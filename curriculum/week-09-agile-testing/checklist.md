## 💡 Tips for Success

**Exercise 1 (Quadrants):**
- Most tests will be Q2 (functional) - this is expected for UI testing
- Security tests (SQL injection, XSS) go in Q4
- UI/UX tests (password masking, images) go in Q3
- Don't worry about having 0 tests in Q1 (no unit tests for UI testing)

**Exercise 2 (BDD):**
- Use plain language - avoid technical jargon
- "I am on the login page" not "Navigate to https://www.saucedemo.com"
- Specific values: "standard_user" not "valid username"
- Group scenarios by Feature for organization

**Exercise 3 (AC):**
- Each AC should be independently testable
- Use Given-When-Then format (same as BDD)
- Cover both happy path and error scenarios
- Make AC measurable (clear pass/fail)

**Exercise 4 (DoD):**
- DoD is broader than AC (technical + functional completeness)
- Include cross-browser testing, security, performance, docs
- Story-specific items complement generic DoD
- Think: "What else must be done beyond AC?"

**Exercise 5 (Sprint Planning):**
- Consider dependencies (US-002 depends on US-001)
- Don't over-commit (40 hours capacity, not 50)
- Identify risks early (environment, ambiguity, dependencies)
- Break down testing into specific tasks with hours
