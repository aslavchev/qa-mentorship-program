# Mentee Setup Guide

Welcome to the 11-Week QA Fundamentals Program! Follow these steps to get started.

## 📋 Before Week 1

### Step 1: Create GitHub Account
1. Go to https://github.com/
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Choose a professional username (e.g., yourname-qa, john-doe-tester)
4. Complete registration

### Step 2: Create Your Work Repository
1. Log in to GitHub
2. Click "New" repository
3. Name it: `qa-fundamentals-journey`
4. Make it **Public** (so mentor can see your work)
5. Check ✅ "Add a README file"

└── [... through week-11]
```

**How to create folders:**
1. In your repository, click "Add file" → "Create new file"
2. Type: `week-01/README.md`
3. GitHub will automatically create the `week-01/` folder

### Step 4: Test SauceDemo Access

2. Login with:
   - Username: `standard_user`
   - Password: `secret_sauce`
3. Explore the application (5-10 minutes)
4. Logout when done

### Step 5: Install Tools (Optional for Week 1)

**For later weeks, you'll need:**
