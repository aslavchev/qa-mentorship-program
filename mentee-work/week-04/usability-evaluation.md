# Week 4 – Usability Evaluation

## 1. Navigation
- The main navigation is simple (Products → Cart → Checkout).
- Links and buttons are easy to find.
- User can move between pages without confusion.
- Back/Continue buttons behave as expected.

## 2. Layout & Readability
- Text is readable and well-spaced.
- Product cards look clean and consistent.
- No overlapping elements.
- Buttons have clear labels (“Add to Cart”, “Checkout”, etc.).

## 3. User Flow
- Login → Products → Cart → Checkout → Confirmation is straightforward.
- No unnecessary steps in the purchase process.
- User always knows what the next step is.

## 4. Feedback & Errors
- Error messages on login and checkout are visible and clear.
- Invalid input is highlighted properly.
- Page gives feedback after adding/removing items.

## 5. Mobile Friendliness
- Page elements scale correctly on smaller screens.
- Buttons are large enough to tap.
- No horizontal scrolling needed.

## 6. Consistency
- Buttons, colors, and fonts are consistent across pages.
- Product layout identical across items.
- Same style for error messages throughout the app.

## 7. Overall Notes
The site is fast and responsive when the user logs in with standard_user credentials. Each element is visible and easy to find. The happy path(login, add to cart, checkout, pay, ready) is easy to navigate and follow through. One issue I observed is that you cannot change the quantity of products in the cart which can be annoying for the user if they want to add more than one from the same product. Also, I think it would be good to have the price including tax earlier in the buying process to give more clarity to the user about how much he actually has to pay.
