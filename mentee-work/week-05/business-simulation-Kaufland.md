# Business Simulation – Kaufland

**Date:** 30.11.2025
**Event:** Kaufland Business Simulation

## Overview

Complementary to my work this week, I attended a business simulation from Mentor the Young in collaboration with Kaufland, one of the biggest companies in Bulgaria with over 8000 employees. The simulation focused on generating improvement ideas for various areas of Kaufland stores, including eggs, alcohol, bread, cheese, butter, fruits, and vegetables.

## Activities

Participants were divided into teams. Each team analyzed different store areas and brainstormed strategies for improvement. We prepared presentations to showcase our ideas, focusing on product refreshment, customer attraction, and effective merchandising.

## Key Learnings

During the simulation, I learned to think strategically and holistically about store operations. I practiced innovative approaches to attract customers and developed skills in selling ideas convincingly through presentations. Collaborating in a team reinforced the importance of clear communication and shared planning.

## Personal Reflection

The simulation was very enjoyable and practical. It allowed me to apply creativity and strategic thinking in a realistic scenario while learning to consider multiple factors that affect customer experience and store performance. Our team won second place, and we were told that our ideas were very close to a real offer recently submitted to Kaufland by a large international partner company, which made the experience even more motivating and validating.
